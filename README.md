# ML-DEECo for Security rules

This is an accompanying repository to the paper *Machine-learning abstractions for component-based self-optimizing systems* by 
Michal Töpfer, Milad Abdullah, Tomáš Bureš, Petr Hnětynka, and Martin Kruliš.

## Contents

There are several folders in this repository:

* [`ml_deeco`](ml_deeco) &ndash; implementation of the ML-DEECo framework.
* [`ml_deeco/examples`](ml_deeco/examples)
  * [`simple_example`](ml_deeco/examples/simple_example) &ndash; a simple example showing basic usage of the ML-DEECo framework.
  * [`all_example`](ml_deeco/examples/all_example) &ndash; example of all predictions defined in the taxonomy (serves mainly as a test of the implementation).
* [`smart_factory`](smart_factory) &ndash; simulation of the example (smart access to factory, late workers) showcased throughout the paper (with a replication package).
* [`machine_failure`](machine_failure) &ndash; simulation of another example (failing production machines) from the paper (with a replication package).
